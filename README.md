# EpicMaterialCalculator

## This project is not complete and I rarely update it as I have made the exact same functionality in Python. (I'll upload that instead of this C# app later on.)

An epic material calculator for Mir4, input all your resources from uncommon to rare, darksteel, copper and glittering powder and it will tell you how much copper, darksteel, glittering powder you are missing to turn all those materials to their epic counterparts.


Guidelines:
  1. No negatives as inputs.
  2. All textboxes must have a value, if you do not have that material input in 0.

Requirements:
  1. You will need .NET 5 Runtime for desktop apps.
 
 
This is just a simple project I made to get to know windows forms better.
